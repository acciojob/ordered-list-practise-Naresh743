    <h1>Understanding Code Optimization</h1>
    <p>We can optimize a solution using both time and space optimization. To optimize a program,</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Reduce the time taken to execute the program while potentially increasing the space utilized.</li>
        <li>Minimize the memory usage of the program while potentially increasing its runtime.</li>
        <li>Deploy relevant algorithms to reduce both time and space complexity effectively.</li>
    </ol>
